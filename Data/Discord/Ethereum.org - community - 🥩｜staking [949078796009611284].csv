**Solo Staking** - Bring 32 ETH and your own node
**Shared Staking** - Bring some amount of ETH, and your own node
**Exchange/Pool Staking** - Bring any amount of ETH, no technical requirement
I am not sure about the name ""shared staking"" but it does align with the future around DVT/SSV. From a Rocket Pool perspective, we would obviously be in both Pool Staking and Shared Staking. This may help with cleaner characteristics for each provider.

Oh and FYI Rocket Pool is FOSS.
Thank you for helping to demystify the staking ecosystem.","","❤️ (1),👌 (1)"

There is potential for e.org and wider EF to get a lot of value from having a deeper understanding of who we are talking to, understand their pain points in order to address these and help educate as much as is possible.

I’m aware of some reservations around privacy and nothing that could identify a user would be used.

Matomo is already used on the E.org site and has marketplace plugins that can already help create heat maps etc

By reading this page, I get the impression that I can only stake with rocket pool by exchanging ETH for their token. This is correct, but incomplete.

As you may know, rocket pool has two main roles:
  - _stakers_ - Anyone can exchange their ETH for the rocket pool staking token. This is the standard ""staking"" procedure for all pools
  - _node operators_ - Anyone, as long they have 16 ETH + 1.6 ETH of RPL, hardware to run an execution client, beacon client and validator clients, can operate a full 32-ETH validator (called a minipool in rocket pool). 16 ETH come from the node operator, and 16 ETH come from the pool. The node operator will earn full staking rewards on their 16 ETH share, plus a 15% commission on the other 16 ETH rewards. More details on this: <https://rocketpool.net/node-operators>

So basically, while I think the _staker_ role is aptly described, the page seems to ignore  the _node operator_ role. This is one of the main rocket pool differentiators: anyone can actively secure the network with 16 (+ 1.6) ETH (i.e. run a full validator) as opposed to simply delegating their ETH to a staking pool. A rocket pool node operator will run the same software stack as a solo staker, will keep full custody of the validator keys, and can choose whatever software stack they wish (geth+nimbus, besu+lighthouse, etc.)","",""

Solo staking on Ethereum is the gold standard for staking. It provides full participation rewards, improves the decentralization of the network, and never requires trusting anyone else with your funds.

Those considering solo staking should have at least 32 ETH and a dedicated computer connected to the internet ~24/7. Some technical know-how is helpful, but easy-to-use tools now exist to help simplify this process.

The original cohort of validators would certainly not fall into the trustless camp as the article @Joshua posted suggests. My understanding is there is still an ability for validators to hold funds hostage with the inability for stakers to force exit their funds (thus relying on the node operators themselves to manually exit). https://ethresear.ch/t/0x03-withdrawal-credentials-simple-eth1-triggerable-withdrawals/10021 Lido noted this proposal as a means to potentially fix this.

You are certainly right that only the node operators are able to exit. But that's a general limitation of every staking pool at the moment, particularly also of Rocket Pool and stakefish, which did get the Trustless checkmark. You could make the case that no staking pool is truly trustless right now based on this, but I'm not sure if it would be useful information to display at that point.

So it's not 1-validator-1-vote... your ""voting power"" is known as the ""effective balance"" which starts at, and is capped at 32 (for a given set of validator keys), and can be decremented in whole number amounts if your account balance drops below certain thresholds (and visa-versa on the way up, again capped at 32):
https://www.attestant.io/posts/understanding-validator-effective-balance/#what-is-effective-balance
The lowest your _effective balance_ can go (in the current spec) is 17, and once your account balance hits 16 the validator is force exited from the validator pool.

This effective balance is an integer that represents the weight of the vote behind your validator keys, and is what is used to calculate your base rewards. This is because this is the ETH that is at stake, and is the fundamental premise behind PoS. 
Capping each set of validator keys at this arbitrary ETH amount prevents centralizing too much voting power in a single set of signing keys. It doesn't stop one entity from allocating their ETH amongst as many signing keys as they want (in 32 ETH increments), but it does prevent one set of keys having this much power towards network consensus within the protocol.","","🔥 (1)"

A validator with 32 ETH available to be slashed for misbehavior has more risk attached to their attestations than a validator account with only 17 ETH available to be slashed for misbehaved, thus their vote is weighted more heavily, and rewards as well.","",""

An AMM is an alternative to a ""order book"" typically used by centralized exchanges. Order books are filled with ""bids"" (buy orders) and ""asks"" (sell orders), and they represent ""maker"" orders. Someone else could then accept those offers by buying or selling at market rate... they represent the ""taker""... An AMM, or ""automated market maker"" refers to an alternative setup where funds are always available for ""taking"", acting automatically as a market maker.

This is made possible only by having liquidity available for the taking. Liquidity providers are incentivized through fees on the trades that occur using the funds they've provided. ""Liquidity mining"" is typically when an AMM platform issues additional rewards, usually in the form of their own token, to LPs to further attract them to provide liquidity on their platform, since it is essential making an AMM work. And ""yield farming"" is when users hunt down all the highest returns, farming the best yields they can find.","",""

The 21-day thing is an **extreme** case when the network is not finalizing (<2/3 validators are online)... only in that extreme case do offline validators get hit with exponential penalties.... this still isn't slashing though.

1) I learned you need to deposit 32 ETH. Can you get it back if needed? I understand the risks involved with validator misbehavior or hacks.
2) What can one expect to earn as a validator? I guess it’s hard to predict because of uncertainties associated with MEV boost, blocks produced and nr of validators in the network. 
3) It’s a pure PoS protocol right (I only have a bit of experience with delegated PoS)? Does that mean each validator should have more or less equal chance to validate a block?","",""
"397809066115727383","wackerow","2022-07-06T06:31:13.7080000+08:00","Hey great questions... I can try to help
1) If you deposit 32 ETH, you are still the owner of those funds, and yes* you can get them back.... * Just not until after the Shanghai update... that will be 6 months to a year after The Merge. Although staking withdrawals are _currently_ not possible, you're still in control of the keys to eventually withdrawal.
2) <https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/?asset=ethereum-2-0> This can help in understanding the base rate of return you should expect as a validator. The base rewards are dependent on total ETH staked, currently ~13 million ETH, with APY around 4-5% range (...depending on number of proposals, discussed next). You're right that MEV is less straight forward to predict and calculate in, and is not included in this APY (but will be available after The Merge)
3) Great question.. Yes, Ethereum is transitioning to a pure PoS model, which does not natively support delegated PoS. All pooled staking is done _outside_ of the protocol, often using smart contracts. A ""validator"" is basically a new account, controlled by a private key, which can be added to the registry of active validators by depositing 32 ETH. Note that it's controlled by a single private key, and there is no concept of delegating staking power within Ethereum's PoS.
> Does that mean each validator should have more or less equal chance to validate a block?
Yup.  1 ""validator"" = 32 ETH to activate => each having the same random chance of being selected to propose a block as everyone other validator. Note there is an element of ""luck"" here on certain time scales, as some validators will get more than predicted proposals by chance, and others will get less by chance.","",""

When the network is in low activity, more eth is issued. The supply grows. This incentivises spending. 

Incentivised spending increases network activity. Increased network activity burns eth through eip1559. As more gets burned, the supply of eth reduces, becoming scarse and more valuable. This causes users to hold and not spend. When the lesser network activity drops, gas prices come down, less eth is burned and the network becomes inflationary again, incentivising spending.

And thus a cyclic loop occurs.","","🍞 (1)"

1) the consensus layer (Beacon Chain) will only be dealing with POS + enabling withdrawal rewards or crediting of validator funds to have  32 ETH in case they get slashed . Withdrawal funds will be credited back to the execution layer (ETh1)
2) the transfers between two accounts will only happen in the execution layer (ETh1), smart contract supports etc also will only be in Eth1 or in other rollups connected to the beacon chain.
3) Withdrawal will cost no transaction fees and will be automatically credited back to the validator ethereum address in the execution layer

> with the withdrawal hardfork will come a tool that can be used to make a one time change to set a withdrawal address, if you chose not to set it while creating the deposit file. This will use your mnemonic.

My understanding here is if you didn't set an `eth1_withdrawal_address` then you will use your BLS withdrawal keys to set one eventually when withdrawals are enabled. In either case, you'll certainly be able to access your rewards on the execution layer after withdrawals are implemented as long as you have access to the set `eth1_withdrawal_address`, or if not set, your validator mnemonic (and thus withdrawal keys).","",""

To run a node (Validator), you will need 32 ETH, and need to set it up and manage from a tech perspective. If you don't want to run the tech or don't have 32 ETH then you really have 3 options: 

1) Stake 32 ETH with a node provider who will do all the tech side for you and take a small commission (There are many out there including RockX)

2) Stake with a liquid staking solution (Like Lido) where you can stake smaller amounts and get an alternate token like a proof of purchase/ability to be liquid (sell/trade as needed), but this interacts directly with a smart contract which has it's own risks

3) Stake in a staking pool, which has no minimum (normally), and the pool owner will run the node, this has larger risks often when it comes to slashing as the penalty increases when more nodes are slashed in the same incident, and since pools often run many nodes, if they cause an offense (most commonly bug or human error) then the penalty is higher than for a solo staker/node provider. 

This is only a very brief intro, so definitely need to do more research, but I'll share my infographic soon, and others can add their 2c too I'm sure","",""

2.Attesting to contradictory blocks in one epoch: Validator signs two different attestations for the same target in the same epoch.
3.Surround Vote Violation: Validator casts a vote which is “surrounded” by a previous vote, meaning the validator is trying to vote against history, which is a slashable offense.

When it happens, some or all of malicious node's staked ETH is confiscated for proposing or confirming fraudulent blocks. Hope this clarify 🙂","",""

I've been wondering since the move to PoS how the economics have been impacted and where I could find resources about that subject.  In particular I wonder compared to PoW the reasons a ""miner"" would sell his rewards since the operation costs are lower.  For exemple, in PoW, there is a point where it's no longer lucrative for less efficient miners to work on the chain since their cost is higher than their profit, so they are running a deficit causing selling pressure and distribution of assets.  In contrast, in PoS, workers are incentivize to keep augmenting their positions to compound their yield.

How do the voting validators know that the block proposing validator has included all the transactions it should?
Or that all the transactions were valid? It checks each transaction itself within the proposed block?","",""
"871453859917230150","greencap75","2023-02-27T13:54:23.2140000+08:00","Validators in Ethereum use a consensus algorithm called Proof of Stake to agree on the transactions that should be included in the next block. In this algorithm, validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of ether they hold and are willing to ""stake"" as collateral.

When a validator is selected to create a new block, they will gather a list of transactions from the network's mempool, which is a pool of unconfirmed transactions. The validator will then validate each transaction by checking that it has a valid signature, has enough funds to complete the transaction, and meets any other relevant criteria.

Once the validator has validated all the transactions, they will create a new block that includes a reference to the previous block and the list of validated transactions. This new block is then broadcast to the network.

Other validators in the network will then verify the validity of the new block by checking the cryptographic signature of the block's creator and by checking that the block's transactions are valid. If the block is deemed valid by enough validators, it will be added to the blockchain, and the transactions it contains will be considered confirmed.

To answer your last question, validators do not need to check each transaction within the proposed block individually. Instead, they will check the overall validity of the block, which includes all of the transactions it contains. This approach allows for a more efficient and scalable consensus algorithm than the proof of work algorithm used in Bitcoin, which requires validators to solve complex mathematical problems for each block.","","👀 (1),🙏 (1)"

Firstly it all comes down to what type of staking you want to get to and how much you want to use in staking as there are several secured platform. For solo staking where you run your own validator, you need minimum 32ETH to do that and there are also options of pool staking which is contributing power of different users. Different pool offers different APR and minimum amount to stake. But the better one in my opinion so far according to research and what I use is LIDO. Don’t know if you know of it. it’s also easy to use 


Rocketpool, stakefish and Binance are another one if you are not thinking of being a validator alone but want to use lesser than 32ETH but wouldn’t recommend Binance more because it’s centralized unlike Staking via decentralized platform which is more secured as you have control. but If you concern on transparency and security then LIDO is your best option","","✅ (1)"

1) Is anyone able to estimate the number of light nodes or non-validator nodes on the Ethreum network? (any beaconcha.in like websites for this?)
2) There seem to be around 15 000 nodes on the mainnet, however there are over 500 000 validator nodes. Is this because each node can run multiple validators? Surely not every node is a full node and running (on average) over 30 validators?","",""

2) each node can run more than one validator, and that's what a lot of people do, the max number of validators a single node can run depends on the hardware and the network it runs on
the 15,000 nodes shown in nodewatch are consensus clients, not execution clients","","👍 (1)"

1. what are 0x00 and 0x01 withdrawal credentials prefixes?

A: The beacon chain validators contain a field known as withdrawal credentials. The first two bytes of this credential are known as the withdrawal prefix. This value is currently either 0x00 or 0x01. The value is set when the deposit is made by a deposit tool. Validators with 0x00 withdrawal credentials will not immediately be able to withdraw. These validators will need to migrate to 0x01 before partial withdrawals and full withdrawals are enabled and their funds unlocked. This migration is a one time process, so please do so with utmost caution.

2. Once I have changed my credential to 0x01, can I change it to an alternative withdrawal address?

A: No, the migration from 0x00 to 0x01 is a one time process and the Ethereum address set cannot be changed. Please make this migration with the utmost care.

you can read more on here on options available. I also wouldn’t recommend centralized exchanges staking  as well. Rocketpool and  project interface has been a great staking platform  for me using decentralized wallet like Metamask.  I use project interface though because of the APY and easy for solo and pool staking  and still prefarable for staking as as a service if you don’t want to do solo using hardware wallet 

You can also check lido out or stakefish. They all are secured","","🤙 (1)"

I'm not an expert who can read their contract. I worry about that some hacker attack or extreme market change will cause the ratio of stETH : ETH no more 1:1. I saw many ETHs staked into Lido and maybe they trusted the contract will not be compromised. But I'm looking for some methods almost as safe as solo. Will SaaS a better way than liquid pools?","",""

Yes in pool liquid staking, your ETH is actually swapped for StETH. The advantage pool staking has is the option to stake lesser than 32 ETH to run your own validator.
and yes we cannot fully overlooked the inherent risk that most liquid staking pool like lido have. In the sense that they could contain a smart contract vulnerability or bug. 

So often  time these pools code are often open-sourced, and covered by a comprehensive bug bounty program to reduce this risk of smart contract hack. Which is why they have been effective at least.

Also in regards to staking as a service in comparison with pool staking, all has thier risk and benefits","",""
"1057180641512402976","danniyok","2023-04-28T15:34:29.0050000+08:00","With SaaS, you have  the advantage of your own validators keys similar to solo staking without having to pool funds unlike pool staking where you sometimes give up access to the keys that allows withdrawing or transferring of staked funds.  

With SaaS, once you deposit your 32 ETH, you will be able to activate your own set of signing keys that will participate in Ethereum consensus. Monitor your progress and watch ETH rewards accumulate. It’s also easy and less risk involved compared to pool.  Only similarity SaaS has with pool is that you're generally relying on someone else which is the service provider to run the validator client but with SaaS, User maintains custody of any validator credentials, including signing and withdrawal keys

There are also certain criteria to look out for when choosing a SaaS provider. I Solo stake and also use a service as well before I got an hardware wallet so been experienced with both","",""

A week ago the staking pools section of the website has been updated to include ""Origin Ether"", featured as the first option. What is Origin Ether? It's actually not an LST at all and just a defi yield protocol that deposits your funds into other projects like Convex, Rocket Pool, Lido, and something called Morpho.

Imo this is a big fail by the maintainers of <https://ethereum.org/> by exposing uninformed users to additional risk that they're likely unaware of, and would love to ignore with the site advertising 9.19% APY.

On top of that, it has a green checkmark for execution diversity, yet both Rocket Pool and Lido have a question mark. How can that be? It also has only 265 holders and only $35M TVL: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x856c4Efb76C1D1AE02e20CEB03A2A6a08b0b8dC3>

In the past I have been staking my eth through liquid staking options, but looking for some more security, a challenge and perhaps more rewards by running my own validator. Got two questions.

1. Is it correct that you can get more rewards by running your own node versus a liquid staking alternative? Noticed that with fees / mev you can get up to 5.9%, while liquid pools give you 3.7%.

2. Is there any dashboard where you can see current withdrawal queues? Wondering how long it takes to fully withdraw your 32 eth stack","",""

I published an in-depth explainer on EIP-7251 for those interested in learning more about the proposal to increase `MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE` from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH for validators and implement in-protocol validator consolidation as a solution to the problem of contracting the Beacon Chain's validator set: https://ethereum2077.substack.com/p/eip-7251-increase-max-effective-balance. 

The article explains how EIP-7251 modifies aspects of the consensus protocol like validator activation, deposits, withdrawals, and slashing penalties to enable validator consolidation while preserving the Beacon Chain’s existing security properties. It also addresses issues regarding increased slashing risk for large validators and (potential) regulatory issues arising from implementing EIP-7251's auto-compounding rewards feature.","","🙏 (1)"

presumably >80% or just generally huge amounts staked wouldn't be very useful since the issuance to the stakers vs the overall inflation would be not much - though, at that point there's not much of an incentive vs just holding, even factoring in burn from blockspace demand, which at that point are probably lower than the inflation, so it'd be net inflationary - less valuable coin -> less security?
and very small amounts are evidently not ideal either - if you can go from 5% to 6% you're almost definitely getting more security


i'm kind of imagining this: ignoring the particular existing monetary policy of a chain - just factoring in the way proof of stake works on the chain
like ok, ethereum's big deal attack is >66% of stake, so, having 34% staked means it's impossible for a malicious actor to just buy up enough to get 66% of the stake, so that's nice, but maybe more would be better, or maybe less?

basically, if you could engineer a monetary policy of a chain with ethereum's proof of stake model, would targeting a specific % staked be reasonable? i'm imagining like, say you set that % to 35%, if it's above, the rewards gradually drop, so people unstake as opportunity cost rises, and if it's below, the rewards gradually rise so more people stake, until it reaches some equilibrium of ~= the best amount you can pay to get that target amount of stake? (market-determined minimum viable issuance for that target, basically?)","",""

Justin Drake as far as I know spearheaded a lot of the issuance targets which have been obliterated by the popularity of staking (linked videos below) 

Obviously the more staked Eth the higher security, though there seems to be equilibrium for now at 1mil validators @ 4.8% (issuance breakdown here - https://ultrasound.money) 

The threshold to be ""nation-state-attack"" secure was assumed to be much less than what we see now(what exactly I can't recall) . Due to the exceeding popularity of staking,  a new EIP is in the works that allows to consolidate validators (I can't recall EIP # and how far along the progress is - I think it's scheduled for the next update). I am not quite sure how the issuance as a result. I'm a little out of the loop.

Either of these videos (possibly both, likely some crossover) will cover the topic as it stood 2-3 years ago. I think you'll find a lot of your answers and even some answers to questions you didn't even have. 😏
