‚ùå There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

‚û°Ô∏è If you are in need of assistance, you can reach out to our Live Chat Support Team by Tapping üëâ Here! (https://www.binance.com/en/chat)
If you are still confused regarding how to contact Support, See this How-To üëâ Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VelozCwX28&t=5s)
You may also want to read how the New support system works (https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/c5554bd4a2d8434082f4f9a08a524c8b)

Reminder:

The Binance Discord Server is a platform for discussion.
- Advertising coins or projects unaffiliated with Binance CEX result in a kick/ban.
- Offensive imagery/language > Ban
- Animated emoji spammer will be muted/kicked/banned (As the case may be)
- Massive shilling (rockets, moon) and senseless dropping of coin names will be punished also.
- No PM, DM, message me
- No trading advice. No buy ABC, no sell XYZ.
- No links to groups/websites unrelated to Binance.

Thank you and happy chatting!","","üöà (1)"

‚ùå There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

‚û°Ô∏è If you are in need of assistance, you can reach out to our Live Chat Support Team by Tapping üëâ Here! (https://www.binance.com/en/chat)
If you are still confused regarding how to contact Support, See this How-To üëâ Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VelozCwX28&t=5s)

Reminder:

The Binance Discord Server is a platform for discussion.
- Advertising coins or projects unaffiliated with Binance CEX result in a kick/ban.
- Offensive imagery/language > Ban
- Animated emoji spammer will be muted/kicked/banned (As the case may be)
- Massive shilling (rockets, moon) and senseless dropping of coin names will be punished also.
- No PM, DM, message me
- No trading advice. No buy ABC, no sell XYZ.
- No links to groups/websites unrelated to Binance.

Thank you and happy chatting!","",""

‚ùå There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

‚û°Ô∏è If you are in need of assistance, you can reach out to our Live Chat Support Team by Tapping üëâ Here! (https://www.binance.com/en/chat)
If you are still confused regarding how to contact Support, See this How-To üëâ Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VelozCwX28&t=5s)

Reminder:

The Binance Discord Server is a platform for discussion.
- Advertising coins or projects unaffiliated with Binance CEX result in a kick/ban.
- Offensive imagery/language > Ban
- Animated emoji spammer will be muted/kicked/banned (As the case may be)
- Massive shilling (rockets, moon) and senseless dropping of coin names will be punished also.
- No PM, DM, message me
- No trading advice. No buy ABC, no sell XYZ.
- No links to groups/websites unrelated to Binance.

I have question about Binance Bridge.

When I‚Äôm trying to use Binance Bridge to move my funds from Erc20 to Bep20
I don‚Äôt have option to swep some BNB gas in order, which option is available on all tutorials which I watched.

This feature doesn't supported any more?
Or is suspended for some reason in last days?

Someone can tell if this option will be available again or maybe I'm doing something wrong.
I need get some BNB on my Bep20 wallet to to pay fee for transaction on this network.

Binance Bridge has any support to ask them about that?

any info would help me a lot, thanks","",""

‚ùå There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

‚û°Ô∏è If you are in need of assistance, you can reach out to our Live Chat Support Team by Tapping üëâ Here! (https://www.binance.com/en/chat)
If you are still confused regarding how to contact Support, See this How-To üëâ Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VelozCwX28&t=5s)

Reminder:

The Binance Discord Server is a platform for discussion.
- Advertising coins or projects unaffiliated with Binance CEX result in a kick/ban.
- Offensive imagery/language > Ban
- Animated emoji spammer will be muted/kicked/banned (As the case may be)
- Massive shilling (rockets, moon) and senseless dropping of coin names will be punished also.
- No PM, DM, message me
- No trading advice. No buy ABC, no sell XYZ.
- No links to groups/websites unrelated to Binance.
