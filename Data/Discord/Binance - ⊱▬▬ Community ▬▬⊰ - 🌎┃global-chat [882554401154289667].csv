❌ There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

⛔️ Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

😇 Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

I have question about Binance Bridge.

When I’m trying to use Binance Bridge to move my funds from Erc20 to Bep20
I don’t have option to swep some BNB gas in order, which option is available on all tutorials which I watched.

This feature doesn't supported any more?
Or is suspended for some reason in last days?

Someone can tell if this option will be available again or maybe I'm doing something wrong.
I need get some BNB on my Bep20 wallet to to pay fee for transaction on this network.

Binance Bridge has any support to ask them about that?

any info would help me a lot, thanks","",""

❌ There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

⛔️ Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

😇 Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.
